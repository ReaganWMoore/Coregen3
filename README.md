The Coregen3 genealogy analysis workbench is a C program that is ported to the Mac through an objective-C interface to a Cocoa app.
The workbench analyzes the epistemological properties of knowledge bases (genealogies), applies optimized graph traversal algorithms
to evaluate metrics for Consistency, Correctness, Closure, Connectivity, Coherence, and Completeness.
A Research Genealogy is bundled with Coregen3 and is used to identify a Unifying Ancestry for Western Europeans.
Persons who link their ancestors to the Unifying Ancestry are then related to all Western Europeans.
