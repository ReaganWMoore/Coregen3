The Coregen3 genealogy analysis workbench is a C program that is ported to the Mac through an objective-C interface to a Cocoa app.
The workbench analyzes the epistemological properties of knowledge bases (genealogies), and applies optimized graph traversal algorithms
to evaluate metrics for Consistency, Correctness, Closure, Connectivity, Coherence, and Completeness.
A Research Genealogy is bundled with Coregen3 and is used to identify a Unifying Ancestry for Western Europeans.
Persons who link their ancestors to the Unifying Ancestry are then related to all Western Europeans.  The Unifying Ancestry in turn links to 
Progenitors for Western Europeans.

Coregen3 parses a Gedcom file to load a graph database.  The user interface provides Sort / Search / Scroll options for comparing results
of multiple graph traversal operations.  Coregen3 is dimensioned to handle Gedcom files with up to 350,000 persons. Graph traversal operations
include Ancestors, Descendants, Relatives, Ascents, Descents, Ancestral fractional distribution, Descendant fractional distribution, Lineage of maximal ascent, Lineage of maximal descent, 
Own Cousin analysis, parental cousin analysis, Partition into extended families, Progenitors, Treetops, Lineage to an ancestor, Lineage traversing the smallest number of partitions, and Lineage traversing the smallest number of persons.

Operations on groups of persons include Relationship of group members to a Root person, Common ancestors, Common descendants, and Common Relatives.

Operstions on the Unifying Ancestry include Connection year, Number of Core ancestors of each person in the gedcom file, and Core own cousin.
